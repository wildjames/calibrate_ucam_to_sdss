You gotta do some stuff.

1. Reductions. 

You'll need three reductions, for a run;
    a. Standard star reduction - large apertures to capture all the light of the star. Don't use optimal reductions!
    b. A reduction in the target field, that uses the SAME settings as a. that we can use to find the magnitudes of the comparison star(s)
    c. The target field, with optimised reduction settings, i.e. good SNR on the target.

2. Gather some data

I've pre-calculated the colour term gradients. We want to use an equation of this kind of form:

g_sdss = g_inst - g_zp - k_ext*X - a_g(g-r)

i.e. atmospheric correction applied, colour term accounted for. The file FOUND_VALUES.json contains a_ugr values, calculated from sythetic spectra. This is generated by the script
